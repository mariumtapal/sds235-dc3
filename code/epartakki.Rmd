## Must add changes

## Questions to answer

a. Some activities may deviate from an established pattern, or are just difficult to explain from what you know of a situation. Describe any unusual patterns (either single day or multiple days) and highlight why you find them unusual.
b. What are the top 3 patterns you discovered that you suspect could be most impactful to bird life in the preserve?
c. Turning your attention to the sensor data, characterize the sensorsâ€™ performance and operation. - Are they all working properly?
d. Can you detect any unexpected behaviors of the sensors through analyzing the readings they capture?
