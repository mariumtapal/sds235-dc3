For Data Challenge 3 we were asked as experts in visual analytics to help Mitch Vogel analyze these datasets since he has been discovering signs that the number of nesting pairs of the Rose-Crested Blue Pipit is decreasing. Something is suspicious, but what?

# What does the Traffic Data tell us?

## “Patterns of Life” analyses depend on recognizing repeating patterns of activities by individuals or groups. Describe some of the daily patterns of life you observe in the vehicles traveling through and within the park. Characterize the patterns by describing:

### the kinds of vehicles
The most common type of vehicles that entered the park was single axle vehicles.  Over the recorded months in 2015, over 67,000 1 axle vehicles appeared in the park.  About 40,000 and 27,000 2 and 3 axle vehicles, respectively entered the park.  Nearly 24,000 park service vehicles entered and exited the park.  While fewer than 14,000 4, 5 and 6 axle vehicles were in the park.

```{r}
common_type <- lekagul_sensor_data %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  count(type)
common_type

common_vehicle_type <- ggplot(common_type, aes(x = reorder(type, -n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Most Common Vehicles Types in Boonsong Lekagul Nature Preserve", x = "Vehicle Type", y = "Number of Vehicles")
common_vehicle_type
```

Vehicle IDs 20154519024544-322, 20154112014114-381 and 20155705025759-63 were frequent travelers in the park.  Sensors across all locations of the park detected vehicle 20154519024544-322 exactly 281 times, vehicle 20154112014114-381 nearly 100 times and vehicle 20155705025759-63 exactly 70 times, while all other vehicles were detected 49 times or less.

```{r}
common_id <- lekagul_sensor_data %>%
  count(id, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  filter(rank(desc(n)) > 0)
common_id

common_vehicle_id <- ggplot(common_id, aes(x = reorder(id, -n), y = n))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Top Ten Vehicles IDs in Boonsong Lekagul Nature Preserve", x = "Vehicle ID", y = "Number of Vehicles") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 270))
common_vehicle_id
```

### their spatial activities (where do they go?)
Since vehicle ID 20154519024544-322 had the highest amount of travel, we chose to take a closer look at it. 

The most common destination for all vehicle ID 20154519024544-322 was camping4 with 32 visits.  Entrance4, general-gate1, general-gate2, general-gate4, general-gate5, general-gate7, ranger-stop0 and ranger-stop2 all saw 31 visits from this particular vehicle.  Entrance1 only saw one visit from vehicle ID 20154519024544-322.

```{r}
common_gate_20154519024544_322 <- id_20154519024544_322 %>%
  count(gate, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(rank(desc(n)) > 0)
common_gate_20154519024544_322
```

### their temporal activities (when does the pattern happen?)

In analyzing vehicle ID 20154519024544-322’s travel patterns, we realized that their movement is very regular.  It seems to be the case that the number of days between travel is somewhat constant.

```{r}
# making day column and converting it to integer value
day_20154519024544_322 <- lekagul_dateparse %>%
  mutate(day = format(Timestamp, "%d")) %>%
  mutate(day = as.integer(day)) %>%
  filter(id == "20154519024544-322") 
day_20154519024544_322

# subtracting consecutive dates to see number of days between each movement
diff_day_20154519024544_322 <- day_20154519024544_322 %>%
    mutate(day_diff = day - lag(day))
diff_day_20154519024544_322

# accounting for changes in month
diff_day_20154519024544_322$day_diff[30] = 4
diff_day_20154519024544_322$day_diff[111] = 4
diff_day_20154519024544_322$day_diff[192] = 5
diff_day_20154519024544_322$day_diff[264] = 4
diff_day_20154519024544_322[diff_day_20154519024544_322 == 0] <- 0.07
diff_day_20154519024544_322

# visualizing
diffday_20154519024544_322 <- ggplot(diff_day_20154519024544_322, aes(x = date, y = day_diff))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Number of Days Between Movement for ID 20154519024544-322", 
       x = "Date", 
       y = "Number of Days Between Movement",
       caption = "*Note: dates in which there are stacks or ridges on the bar indicate that vehicle ID 20154519024544-322 \n triggered sensors in multiple locations during that day") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 270)) 
diffday_20154519024544_322
```

When vehicle ID 20154519024544-322 travels in the park, they usually take the same route to camping4, stay there for two days, leave the way they entered, then repeat the pattern every four days or so.  

### and provide a hypothesis of what the pattern represents (for example, if I drove to a coffee house every morning, but did not stay for long, you might hypothesize I’m getting coffee “to-go”).

We guess that vehicle ID 20154519024544-322 is making a delivery of some sort or perhaps picking something up.  Patterns and hypotheses for vehicle ID 20154112014114-381 (the vehicle with the second highest sensor detection throughout the park) are similar to that of vehicle ID 20154519024544-322.

```{r}
dateparse_20154112014114_381 <- lekagul_dateparse %>%
  filter(id == "20154112014114-381") %>%
  count(date, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(rank(desc(n)) > 0)
dateparse_20154112014114_381

common_date_20154112014114_381 <- ggplot(dateparse_20154112014114_381, aes(x = reorder(date, -n), y = n))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Dates with Most Frequent Travel for ID 20154112014114-381", x = "Date", y = "Number of Locations Visited") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 270))
common_date_20154112014114_381

# making day column and converting it to integer value
day_20154112014114_381 <- lekagul_dateparse %>%
  mutate(day = format(Timestamp, "%d")) %>%
  mutate(day = as.integer(day)) %>%
  filter(id == "20154112014114-381") 
day_20154112014114_381

# subtracting consecutive dates to see number of days between each movement
diff_day_20154112014114_381 <- day_20154112014114_381 %>%
    mutate(day_diff = day - lag(day))
diff_day_20154112014114_381

# accounting for changes in month
diff_day_20154112014114_381$day_diff[43] = 5
diff_day_20154519024544_322[diff_day_20154519024544_322 == 0] <- 0.07

diff_day_20154112014114_381

# visualizing

  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Number of Days Between Movement for ID 20154112014114-381",

```


## Some patterns may appear over longer periods of time (in this case, over multiple days). Describe a few patterns of life that occur over longer time periods by vehicles traveling through and within the park. You may want to use the same what-where-when breakdown described above to frame your description.

## Some activities may deviate from an established pattern or are just difficult to explain from what you know of a situation. Describe any unusual patterns (either single day or multiple days) and highlight why you find them unusual.

## What are the top 3 patterns you discovered that you suspect could be most impactful to bird life in the preserve?

# What does the Sensor Data tell us?

## Turning your attention to the sensor data, characterize the sensors’ performance and operation. Are they all working properly?

## Can you detect any unexpected behaviors of the sensors by analyzing the readings they capture?

# What about the chemicals did we find?

## Which chemicals are being detected by the sensor group?

```{r}
p1 <- sensor_data %>%
  group_by(chemical) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date_time, y = reading, color = chemical)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = chemical), alpha = 0.4) +
  labs(title = "Sensor Readings by Chemical Type", x = "Month", y = "Monitor Reading")
ggplotly(p1)
```

In the interactive plot above, you can see the readings for each chemical alone by double clicking its name in the legend. Through a first look, the readings of __AGOC-3A__ and __Methylosmolene__ seem very volatile compared to the __Chlorodinine__ and __Appluimonia__. 

We think these are more suspicious than the other two because the ranges of values are way larger as shown by the summary statistics below. While this volatility could be explained by some other factors as the concentration of chemicals (measured in parts per million) can be different for different chemicals, we still think that something is happening. The quartiles, means, and standard deviation are small, but the range is comparatively very large.

```{r}
# make subsetted datasets for summary stats
methylosmolene <- sensor_data %>% filter(chemical == "Methylosmolene")
agoc3a <- sensor_data %>% filter(chemical == "AGOC-3A")
chlorodinine <- sensor_data %>% filter(chemical == "Chlorodinine")
appluimonia <- sensor_data %>% filter(chemical == "Appluimonia")

# make dataframe of summary stats
summary_stats <- rbind(fav_stats(methylosmolene$reading), fav_stats(agoc3a$reading), fav_stats(chlorodinine$reading), fav_stats(appluimonia$reading))

# add chemical name manually
summary_stats <- summary_stats %>% mutate(chemical = c("Methylosmolene", "AGOC-3A", "Chlorodinine", "Appluimonia"))

# calculate range
summary_stats <- summary_stats %>% mutate(range = max - min)

# reorder columns
summary_stats <- summary_stats[, c(10, 11, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)]

# fix row names
rownames(summary_stats)<-c("1","2","3","4")
# print stats
summary_stats %>%
  select(-c(n, missing)) %>%
  knitr::kable() %>%
  kableExtra::kable_minimal(full_width = FALSE)
```

Perhaps this extra volatility/concentration explains the dumping of the chemical in river.

## What patterns of chemical releases do you see?

Investigating further into these chemicals, they are most commonly detected on monitor 6, and then monitor on 3.

### Methylosmolene

From the "Sensor Readings by Chemical Type" graph above, it looks like an average reading for Methylosmolene is about 4 parts per million. We filter for the dataset due to limited computational power: am filtering to check for monitors
``` {r}
d1 <- sensor_data %>% filter(chemical == "Methylosmolene" & reading >= 4)
ggplotly(ggplot(d1, aes(x = date_time, y = reading, color = monitor)) +
  geom_point() + labs(x = "Month", y = "Monitor Reading", 
                       title = "Sensor Readings by Monitor for Methylosmolene"))
```

Most of the higher readings are coming from monitor 6 in April and December!

### AGOC-3A

Similar to Methylosmolene, the average reading also looks like about 4 parts per million.

``` {r}
d2 <- sensor_data %>% filter(chemical == "AGOC-3A" & reading >= 4)
ggplotly(ggplot(d2, aes(x = date_time, y = reading, color = monitor)) +
  geom_point() + labs(x = "Month", y = "Monitor Reading", 
                       title = "Sensor Readings by Monitor for AGOC-3A"))
```

Again, a lot of the higher readings are at monitor 6, especially in April!

## Which factories are responsible for which chemical releases?

Through an investigation of the financial data of these factories reported in the semi-annual newsletters, we are suspicious that the Kasios Office Furniture and Radiance ColourTek are involved in some way. 

```{r}
# create data frame with {datapasta} addin
finance <- data.frame(
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
  Year = c(
    "2012-12-01",
    "2013-03-01", "2013-06-01", "2013-10-01", "2013-12-01",
    "2014-03-01", "2014-06-01", "2014-10-01", "2014-12-01",
    "2015-03-01", "2015-06-01", "2015-10-01", "2015-12-01",
    "2016-03-01", "2016-06-01", "2016-10-01"
  ),
  Indigo = c(
    4.32, 3.56, 2.95, 3.28,
    4.5, 4.16, 3.26, 3.87, 4.91, 3.83, 3.65, 4.24, 5.21,
    4.74, 4.21, 4.57
  ),
  Kasios = c(
    6.24, 6.37, 6.17, 5.49,
    5.23, 4.92, 4.18, 3.25, 2.65, 2.94, 3.48, 4.9, 5.61,
    6.84, 7.23, 7.85
  ),
  Radiance = c(
    7.18, 7.32, 7.09, 7.21,
    7.37, 7.63, 7.29, 8.02, 7.53, 4.18, 4.36, 4.22, 4.89,
    4.71, 5.03, 5.13
  ),
  Roadrunner = c(
    5.53, 5.81, 6.34, 6.73,
    7.14, 6.92, 6.84, 6.95, 6.69, 6.74, 6.53, 6.71, 6.82,
    6.59, 6.71, 6.68
  )
)
finance$Year <- parse_date_time(finance$Year, "Ymd")

# plot
Indigo <- ggplot(finance, aes(x = Year, y = Indigo)) +
  geom_line()
Kasios <- ggplot(finance, aes(x = Year, y = Kasios)) +
  geom_line()
Radiance <- ggplot(finance, aes(x = Year, y = Radiance)) +
  geom_line()
Roadrunner <- ggplot(finance, aes(x = Year, y = Roadrunner)) +
  geom_line()
Indigo + Kasios + Radiance + Roadrunner + plot_annotation(title = "Quaterly Earnings per Share ($) by Company")
```

Looking at the plot above, we see around late 2014 and early 2015, there was a steep decline in the earnings per share of both the above mentioned companies. Kasios quickly recovers, but Radiance does not. 

We are suspicious that Kasios is the “bad player” and Radiance is being “framed” because Kasios’ quick fall and recovery looks too good to be true and the timing coincides with the fall of the Radiance company. 

We are not suspicious of the Roadrunner Fitness Electronics and Indigo Sol Boards factories because there is either a stable increase or decrease in earnings per share around the time frame we are looking at (2014-2016).

The sensors 3 and 6 are also quite close in proximity to the Kasios and Radiance factories.

## For the factories you identified, describe any observed patterns of operation revealed in the data.
